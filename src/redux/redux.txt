Redux

install:
npm i redux --save-dev

1. redux/store/store.js
  - createStore takes a reducer as the first argument
  - state in Redux comes from reducers

2. redux/reducers/reducers.js
  - the only way to change the state is by sending a signal to the store
  - this signal is an action
  - dispatching an action means sending out a signal to the store
  - actions are nothing more than JavaScript objects with two properties: type and payload
  - something like:
    {
      type: "ADD_TASK",
      payload: { title: "Some task name", description: "Description/details" }
    }
  - type is required while payload can be optional

3. redux/actions/actions.js
  - wrap every action within a function

4. redux/actions-types/actions-types.js
  - declare actions as constants as best practice & to avoide duplicates

now import redux in app.js and use from console... ðŸ¤£
